        <h1>Information</h1>
        <h2>General Knowledge</h2>
        <p>General knowledge includes basic information on a variety of topics, such as countries, cultures, historical
            figures, and inventions. People with broad general knowledge are often able to understand various contexts
            and connect ideas across different subjects. General knowledge can be developed through reading, following
            current events, and engaging in cultural activities. It’s valuable for critical thinking, improving
            communication across diverse backgrounds, and aiding in quiz competitions or interviews. Building a strong
            foundation in general knowledge also enhances one's ability to make informed decisions.</p>
        <h2>Science and Nature</h2>
        <p>Science is the systematic study of the natural world and its laws, encompassing fields like physics,
            chemistry, biology, and astronomy. Natural sciences aim to explain natural phenomena with evidence-based
            theories, while nature focuses on ecosystems and living organisms. Scientific research in nature is
            essential for understanding biodiversity and finding solutions for environmental challenges like pollution
            and climate change. Understanding science and nature gives insights into how the world works and fosters a
            sense of responsibility towards environmental sustainability.</p>
        <h2>Computers</h2>
        <p>Computers are electronic devices that process, store, and retrieve data, operating through a combination of
            hardware and software. Since the mid-20th century, computers have evolved drastically, leading to the
            development of personal computers, smartphones, and tablets. Computers play a key role in areas like
            business, education, entertainment, and scientific research. Knowledge of computer basics, such as hardware
            components, programming, networking, and cybersecurity, is crucial for effectively using and securing these
            devices.</p>
        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <p>Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, patterns, and relationships. It relies on logical reasoning and
            quantitative analysis and covers a wide range of topics like arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus.
            Math is fundamental in both natural and social sciences and serves as a foundation for technology and
            engineering. Mathematical thinking helps solve problems, model situations, and make predictions in fields
            like economics, physics, computer science, and engineering.</p>
        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>Sports are competitive physical activities that promote fitness and skill development, benefiting both mental
            and physical health. Sports range from team games like soccer and basketball to individual activities like
            tennis and swimming. Sports foster social skills, sportsmanship, patience, and discipline, and play a
            significant role in culture, with global events like the Olympics and World Cup. Engaging in sports is an
            excellent way for personal expression and building community connections.</p>
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Geography is the study of Earth's landscapes, climates, physical features, and human populations. It’s
            divided into physical geography, which focuses on natural formations and climates, and human geography,
            which studies human activities and distributions. Geography helps us understand how the environment
            influences society and the importance of natural resources, contributing to sustainable development.
            Geographic knowledge is essential for urban planning, resource management, and addressing environmental
            challenges.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>History is the study of past events and the development of human civilizations, providing insights into how
            societies have evolved over time. Historians document and analyze significant events like wars, revolutions,
            social and political changes, and scientific discoveries. Understanding history helps us comprehend the
            roots of modern issues and avoid past mistakes. History also fosters an appreciation of diverse cultures and
            a sense of shared human heritage, enriching our understanding of the world.</p>
